# Day 7: POSIX Shell

No external utilities are used, only built-in shell commands that are in POSIX spec.

Arguably, `printf` is not a special built-in, so it can be an external utility, but it’s used only once (to output the answer),
specified in POSIX Shell specification and is generally built-in.

`[` / `test` are also not special built-ins, but it’s hard to argue that they’re not parts of the POSIX shell.
