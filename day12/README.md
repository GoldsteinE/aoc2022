# Day 12: Raku

That was a disappointment. Documentation is lacking, iterators are really bare-bones and I spent way too much time debugging `(Any)` values.

It’s also slow as hell for some reason (slower than my Python solution). I guess pre-compiling would make this better, but I didn’t find a way to pre-compile Raku code, even though `rakudo --help` seems to imply that it exists.
